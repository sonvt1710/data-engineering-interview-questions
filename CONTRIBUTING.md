## Contributing

Contributions are welcome: new questions, fixes, better links, and formatting improvements.

### Quick checks

Run the local repository checks before opening a PR:

```bash
python3 scripts/repo_checks.py
```

### Content guidelines

- Keep files **UTF-8** encoded.
- Avoid placeholder links like `TODO` in markdown or HTML.
- If you add links in `content/full.md`, make sure the referenced heading exists in the target file.
